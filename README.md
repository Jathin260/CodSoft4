The above code is a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. We are using the Tkinter library to create a GUI. In this application, the user is given three buttons representing the options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The user must select one of these options. The game logic is as follows: Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beat Paper. For example, if the user selects Rock and the computer selects Scissors, the user wins; if both select Rock, it's a tie; and if the user selects Rock while the computer selects Paper, the computer wins. The results will be displayed below. If you want to play again, simply click the button to continue playing.
